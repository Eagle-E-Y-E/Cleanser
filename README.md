# Task1-Image-filtration

## üñºÔ∏è Overview

**Task1-Image-filtration** is a Python-based application designed for applying various image processing techniques. It provides functionalities such as grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, noise addition, filtering, edge detection, thresholding, and hybrid image creation. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Grayscale Conversion**: Transform RGB images to grayscale.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Enhance image contrast using histogram equalization.
- **Noise Addition**: Introduce different types of noise to images for testing.
- **Filtering Techniques**: Apply various filters to images.
- **Edge Detection**: Detect edges within images.
- **Thresholding**: Apply thresholding techniques to segment images.
- **Hybrid Image Creation**: Combine images to create hybrid visuals.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Interact with the application through a GUI.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eagle-E-Y-E/Task1-Image-filtration.git
   cd Task1-Image-filtration
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
